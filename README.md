Just to test some github workflow assumption

Adding this line to skew line numbers below. This can be unsafe for line comments in PR, lets check this out.

### Can I rebase a PR branch on recent master?

I'd like to test this before rebasing my [PR](https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/1232) branch on [docker/compose:master](https://github.com/docker/compose) before working on comments.

Now I rebased `git rebase upstream/master can-i-rebase-pr-on-master` and will push to github. And we'll see how our PR's line comments feel yourself.
